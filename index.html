    Zaha Hadid was a well-respected and groundbreaking architect who was most known for her innovative designs that pushed the boundaries of contemporary architecture. In 2004, the British-Iraqi architect was the first woman to receive the prestigious Pritzker Architecture Prize. When picking my laureate, I wanted to find someone who stuck out from the crowd and Zaha Hadid is able to do that not only as a woman in a male-dominated field but also through her distinct and one-of-a-kind works. Many would say her work consists of dynamic forms, bold geometry, and smooth incorporation of space and structure, constructing work that can be perceived as defying gravity. Even with the disadvantages of being a woman, Zaha never shied away from expressing her bold and unique ideas. Her futuristic approach to architecture transformed urban landscapes and with that inspired a new generation of architects who tested their boundaries when designing.
